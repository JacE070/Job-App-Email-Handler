# Job Application Email Management System for ISP

## Project Overview:
The Job Application Email Management System is a Java-based backend project designed for an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to efficiently handle incoming emails related to online job application responses. The system categorizes three types of incoming emails: confirmation of application submission, invitations to online assessments/interviews, and notifications of rejection or job offers. This project streamlines the email management process for job seekers and recruiters.

## Project Objectives:

1. **Email Reception**: Develop a robust mechanism to receive incoming job application-related emails from external mail servers.

2. **Email Parsing**: Parse received emails to extract relevant information, such as sender, recipient, subject, and email content.

3. **User Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication for job seekers and recruiters to access their respective email accounts.

4. **Filtering Logic**: Create a flexible filtering system that categorizes incoming emails into three types: application confirmation, interview invitations, and rejection/offer notifications.

5. **Email Forwarding**: Forward categorized emails to the appropriate end users' email accounts, ensuring timely and accurate delivery.

6. **User Interface**: Build a user-friendly interface for job seekers and recruiters to manage their email accounts and view categorized job application emails.

7. **Security**: Implement security measures to protect user data and ensure the system's resilience against email-related threats.

8. **Logging and Monitoring**: Set up logging to record system activities and user interactions, and monitor system performance.

9. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation covering system architecture, APIs, and user guides.

10. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Conduct thorough testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, to ensure the system functions correctly and securely.

11. **Deployment**: Deploy the system on a production server or cloud platform, making it accessible to job seekers and recruiters.

12. **Maintenance and Updates**: Plan for ongoing maintenance, security updates, and feature enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
